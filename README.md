# Front Tracker
 
## To Do

### Next
- mark unavailable component digits etc (since it's easier to split into those by tapping fronters)
  - add resting status for digits

### Then
- style present digits by % to fit on one line
- known issues: sort order doesn't always put present headmates first (not fixed; to reproduce )
- search by name + digits
- output as ?active=24,5,6 and generate a link (output to search bar?)
- load from URL parameter
- style: size up the present fronters to be all on one row (when possible) and add some space below that
- show emojis
- connect to PluralKit API
- names off to right side with details?
- refactor to use an object to store current, past, and future states

### Later
- ? silhouette for headmates that don't have portraits
   - suggest picrews from headmates who share digits
- shift click multiple portraits to merge
- CTRL + click headmates to split; pulls up a popup that shows split options/previews the split (that disappears when CTRL is released - split to digits - or an option is clicked)
- ??? + click headmates to mark as stable - show merges of this headmate as unavailable
- search by emojis (use the emoji list in the spreadsheet to allow search by near miss)
- change classes: replace present and available classes with ones for for not available + not fronting
- toggle show/hide: 
  - digits
  - emojis (if portraits aren't shown, make them big?)
  - fursona view (images + names)
  - only current fronters
  - only available members
  - only registered members/members with nicknames
- double click? to pull up details (including Picrew)
- output possible duties to address?
- track what front combinations happen most often
- support undo/redo?
- double click to open pluralkit info page
- add background colors for images without background colors
    - sample from images where present and add those colors to the spreadsheet + PK
